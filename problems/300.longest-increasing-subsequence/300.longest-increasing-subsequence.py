#
# Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly
# increasing subsequence.
# 
# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting
# some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For
# example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the
# length is 4.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time
# complexity?
#

class Solution:
    
    # Dynamic Programming
    # Time complexity: O(N^2)
    # Space complexity: O(N)
