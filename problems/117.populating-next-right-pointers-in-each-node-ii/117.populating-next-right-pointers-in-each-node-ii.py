#
# Given a binary tree
#
#
# struct Node {
# ⁠ int val;
# ⁠ Node *left;
# ⁠ Node *right;
# ⁠ Node *next;
# }
#
#
# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
# next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
#
# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
#
#
#
# Follow up:
#
#
# You may only use constant extra space.
# Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not
# count as extra space for this problem.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
# Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
# Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should
# populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in
# Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next
# pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
# -100 <= node.val <= 100
